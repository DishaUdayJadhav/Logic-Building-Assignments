📁 Assignment4
This folder contains basic C programs focusing on factors and non-factors of a number. Each program demonstrates logic building using loops, conditions, and functions. Below are the covered programs:

✅ List of Programs

Q1.c => Multiplication of Factors

Accepts a number and returns the multiplication of its factors.

Q2.c => Factors in Decreasing Order

Displays all factors of the input number in descending order.

Q3.c => Display Non-Factors

Prints all numbers less than the input which are not its factors.

Q4.c => Summation of Non-Factors

Calculates the sum of all non-factors of the given number.

Q5.c => Difference between Sum of Factors and Non-Factors

Returns the difference between the sum of factors and non-factors of the number.
