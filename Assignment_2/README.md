# ASSIGNMENT_2

This folder contains 5 C programs focused on loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## 📄 Programs Included

1. **Assignment2_q1.c** – Print given number of asterisks (`*`) using `while` loop.
   - Accepts a number from the user and prints that many asterisks using a loop and counter variable.

2. **Assignment2_q2.c** – Print given number of asterisks using decrementing input.
   - Uses the input value itself as a counter and prints asterisks while decrementing.

3. **Assignment2_q3.c** – Display "Hello" if input is less than 10, else display "Demo".
   - Simple conditional check using `if-else` structure.

4. **Assignment2_q4.c** – Print the first number, the second number of times.
   - Takes two inputs: a number and a frequency. Prints the number repeatedly based on the frequency.

5. **Assignment2_q5.c** – Check whether a number is even or odd.
   - Accepts an integer and determines if it’s even or odd using the modulus operator.
