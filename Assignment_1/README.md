# ASSIGNMENT_1

This folder contains 5 C programs covering basic programming logic and syntax, including arithmetic operations, loops, condition checking, and user input handling.

## üìÑ Programs Included

1. **Assignment1_q1.c** ‚Äì Program to divide two numbers.
   - Takes two integers and returns their division result. Returns `-1` if the denominator is zero.

2. **Assignment1_q2.c** ‚Äì Program to print "Marvellous" 5 times.
   - Uses a `for` loop to print the word "Marvellous" five times on the screen.

3. **Assignment1_q3.c** ‚Äì Program to display numbers from 5 to 1.
   - Uses a `while` loop to print numbers in reverse order from 5 to 1.

4. **Assignment1_q4.c** ‚Äì Program to check whether a number is divisible by 5.
   - Accepts a number from the user and checks divisibility using modulus operator.

5. **Assignment1_q5.c** ‚Äì Program to print a given number of asterisks (*).
   - Accepts an integer input and prints that many `*` characters in a row.
